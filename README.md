This library allows you to read and write a list of elements (even from different types, but with the same parent)
item by item from and to an XML file. The goal is to avoid loading a huge amount of data into memory when processing
large files.

## Installation

The dependency is available in maven central (see badge for version):

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.chavaillaz</groupId>
    <artifactId>jaxb-stream</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

## Usage

You can find the following example in the ```StreamingTest``` class. Note that this library also works with JAXB classes
generated by an XSD file. In that case, have a look at the ```StreamingXsdTest``` class.

### Context

You are storing different types of metrics in an XML file. Because of memory constraints and the number of entries, you
cannot load them at once as it would be done with JAXB by unmarshalling the file into the container class.

In order to process them anyway, you can use this library to read or write them, item by item.

In this example, an interface `Metric` is implemented by multiple metric types:

- Disk metrics (class `DiskMetric`, XML element `disk`)
- Memory metrics (class `MemoryMetric`, XML element `memory`)
- Processor metrics (class `ProcessorMetric`, XML element `processor`)

Each metric defines an XML element by using the annotation `@XmlRootElement`. Those metrics would usually be stored in
the container `MetricsList`, representing a list of metrics (container). This list also defines an XML element, in that
case `metrics`, the XML tag for that container.

Below an XML file from that example:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<metrics>
    <disk>
        <disk>/</disk>
        <freePartitionSpace>688865050624</freePartitionSpace>
        <usablePartitionSpace>544384016384</usablePartitionSpace>
        <totalCapacity>700001001472</totalCapacity>
    </disk>
    <memory>
        <freeMemory>521889952</freeMemory>
        <maxMemory>8589934592</maxMemory>
        <totalMemory>536870912</totalMemory>
    </memory>
    <processor>
        <systemLoad>0.25</systemLoad>
        <processLoad>0.18</processLoad>
        <availableProcessors>16</availableProcessors>
    </processor>
    ...
</metrics>
```

### Writing elements

For example, to write two metrics (memory and processor metrics), the following code can be used:

```java
try (StreamingMarshaller marshaller = new StreamingMarshaller(MetricsList.class)) {
    marshaller.open(new FileOutputStream(fileName));
    marshaller.write(MemoryMetric.class, new MemoryMetric());
    marshaller.write(ProcessorMetric.class, new ProcessorMetric());
    ...
}
```

Note that you can also give the root element tag name instead of giving ```MetricsList.class```.

### Reading elements

For example, to read the written metrics (memory and processor metrics), the following code can be used:

```java
try (StreamingUnmarshaller unmarshaller = new StreamingUnmarshaller(MemoryMetric.class, ProcessorMetric.class)) {
    unmarshaller.open(new FileInputStream(fileName));
    unmarshaller.iterate((type, element) -> doWhatYouWant(element));
}
```

or by iterating over each element by yourself:

```java
try (StreamingUnmarshaller unmarshaller = new StreamingUnmarshaller(MemoryMetric.class, ProcessorMetric.class)) {
    unmarshaller.open(new FileInputStream(fileName));
    while (unmarshaller.hasNext()) {
        doWhatYouWant(unmarshaller.next(YourObject.class));
    }
}
```

Note that if the classes given to the `StreamingUnmarshaller` do not have the `XmlRootElement` annotation
(for example if they are generated by XJC from an XSD), you can give the tag names with the classes using a `Map`.

### Complex XML file structure

If the XML file you would like to create or read has a complex structure (meaning the stream of elements to read
is not present right after the root tag), you have the possibility to extends both marshaller and unmarshaller and
override the following methods:

- `createDocumentStart` in `StreamingMarshaller` to write the start of the XML file before the stream of elements
- `close` in `StreamingMarshaller` to write the end of the XML file (note that tags are closed automatically)
- `skipDocumentStart` in `StreamingUnmarshaller` to reach the stream of elements in the document
